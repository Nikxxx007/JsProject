### JsProjects

Here are represented some of my vanilla js projects:
* [first one](https://github.com/Nikxxx007/JsProjects/tree/main/color_flipper) is a page with button which changes the background color randomly
* [counter](https://github.com/Nikxxx007/JsProjects/tree/main/counter) is a page with an int value interaction (increase, decrease or reset)

more project are currently in progress
